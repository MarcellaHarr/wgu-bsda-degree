# Introduction to Analytics

> *Analytics is the creative use of data and statistical modeling to tell a compelling story that not only drives strategic action but also results in business value. Introduction to Analytics examines data analytics as a discipline and the various roles and functions within the field. It expands your knowledge of analytics and helps you develop a basic understanding of statistics, analysis, problem-solving, and programming concepts.*

I thoroughly engaged with the course materials, including all sections, three external course books, and both internal and external videos. Additionally, I completed quizzes for each section and attempted the pre-assessment (PA) three times, passing once and failing twice. Utilizing the study guide provided in the course's resources directory proved beneficial. Personally, I found the pre-assessment (PA) easier compared to the objective assessment (OA).

During my study sessions, I devoted significant attention to the *Data Analytics Lifecycle* section, which comprises the majority of the assessment. Below is the outline of sections per the PA and an additional section from the study guide:

### Section 1

__I successfully completed this course on February 7th, 2024!__

Overall, comprehending the course material was manageable, though I found the wordplay in the objective assessment (OA) unnecessary. Despite participating in three cohorts, I was somewhat disappointed as the content did not fully meet my expectations in terms of coverage. Additionally, I believe that organizing my Anki cards into the three sections and using tags would have made it easier for the cards to transition smoothly, enhancing their coherence.
