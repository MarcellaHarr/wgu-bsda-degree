I read all the course materials for all sections, each of the three external course books, and watched all videos both internal and external. I completed the quizzes for each section and the I did the pre-assessment three times, failing two and passing one so far. I used the study guide offered under the course's resources directory.

When it came time to studying I focused on these three sections outilined in the pre-assessment:

### Section 1
#### Careers and Roles in Data Analytics - 20% of assessment
Book to use is the *Data Science & Big Data Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, Visualizing and Presenting Data* by EMC Education Services

<br>

### Section 2
#### Data Analytics Lifecycle - 50% of assessment

<br>

### Section 3
#### Defining Values for Success in Data Analytics - 30% of assessment
