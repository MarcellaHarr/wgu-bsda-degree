At this point I think I have been saying, "I really enjoy, ..." about most of the course I've taken so far. But I really enjoyed this course. Yes, the focus point is on ethics but it also tied in loads of security protocols, laws, and guidelines not only for the technology industry but for the U.S. government and business sectors. However, comma, there a lot of terms and vocabulary you will have to know. As well as doing a lot reading, too.

Your best bet is to read all the chapters required, complete the study guide, and use either Quizlet or Anki, or whatever flashcard method you can do. Also when reading the chapters complete the study guide as you go along.

*note: do not just study the terms and vocab because you will not pass this objective assessment (OA).*

For the (OA) I had 68 questions and failed only the "Identifies Interventions - 10%". I actually know why I did poorly on this section and that's because I couldn't watch the *AI Ethics: Understanding Bias and Fairness in Your Models* video, it was too boring to watch and the four or five questions asked on the test, I was only able to remember about two of them.
