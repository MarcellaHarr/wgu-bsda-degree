# My Pre-Game Steps

I first went to WGU's [Partnerships'](https://partners.wgu.edu/home) page and selected the platforms I was going to use to help bring in credits. So under the `National Agrements` section, it was between Sophia and Saylor Academy. I actually wanted to use Study.com, but their pricing is too expensive for me. In the end, I went Sophia.com.

### Overview

My projected start date is January 1st, 2024 and I will be majoring in the BS Data Analytics degree. I have 80 credits remaining and plan to graduate in a year.

### Pre-Study Plan

I started my pre-study plan October 9th, 2023 and will continue to do so and during my enrollment. I will try to share all the YouTube playlists, Quizlet flashcards, and Anki Decks (*even my created ones*), as often as I can.
