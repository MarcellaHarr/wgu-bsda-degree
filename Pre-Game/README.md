# My Pre-Game Steps

I first went to WGU's [Partnerships'](https://partners.wgu.edu/home) page and selected the platforms I was going to use to help bring in credits. So under the `National Agrements` side, it was between Sophia and Saylor Academy. I actually wanted to use Study.com, but their pricing is too expensive for me. In the end, I went Sophia.com.
