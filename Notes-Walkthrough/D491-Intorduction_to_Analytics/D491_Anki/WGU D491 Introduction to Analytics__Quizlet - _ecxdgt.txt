their customers, products, and sales transactions. The available data includes
customer demographics, product attributes, purchase history, website clickstream data, and customer feedback.<br><br>which question can be answered using
data analytics based on the available data?
<br><br>&gt; what are the most popular products among customers aged 18-25?
<br>&gt; how many sales transactions were made in the last month?
<br>&gt; what is the total revenue generated by the company since its inception?
<br>&gt; how many employees does the company have?"	"what are the most popular
products among customers aged 18-25? (analyzing this data can help identify popular products among customers aged 18-25 by examining the purchasing behavior and preferences of that specific age group.)"
"A food delivery company would like to study economic conditions' effects
on sales. The analyst in charge of the project is planning on gathering economic data from a well-known blog.<br><br>which question should the analyst consider in
the scenario?"	is the data correct (relying on economic data from a blog requires verification to ensure accuracy and reliability before making conclusions about its impact on sales for the food delivery company.)
"A data analyst is planning the data preparation phase of a data analysis
project. During planning, they consider what to do if the data contains a lot of
outliers.<br><br>which question should the analyst consider in this scenario?"	"what
is the impact of outliers on the analysis? (this question directly addresses the key concern when deciding how to handle outliers during the data preparation phase – understanding their impact on the analysis.)"
"A data analyst is working on a project to identify the main reasons
for customer complaints and is planning to review the data.<br><br>which question
should the analyst consider in this scenario?
<br><br>&gt; are all the relevant variables present?
<br>&gt; do all variables have a known distribution?
<br>&gt; what is the correlation between variables?
<br>&gt; what are the independent variables?"	are all the relevant variables present (this ensures that the data analyst considers whether all the necessary factors or variables that might influence customer complaints are included in the analysis. If important variables are missing, the analysis may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the main reasons for customer complaints.)
"A data analyst plans to explore possible indicators of fraud in bank
transactions. The analyst is considering different tools that can be used to
collect the data needed.<br><br>which question should the analyst consider when
identifying the tool to use?"	what is the format and structure of the data? (understanding the data's format and structure is crucial for selecting a tool that can effectively collect and analyze the specific information needed to identify indicators of fraud in bank transactions.)
A company will survey its customers to understand the potential demand for a new product. A data analyst will review the data.<br><br>which question should the analysis consider to validate the&nbsp;representatively of the data?	"what is the
response rate of the survey? (this helps assess the representativeness of the data by gauging the proportion of customers who participated in the survey, providing insights into potential biases and the reliability of the findings.)"
"A retail company wants to improve customer satisfaction by understanding the factors that influence customer loyalty. The company has collected
customer feedback data from different sources, such as online surveys, social
media platforms, and customer support calls.<br><br>which data analytic technique
should be used to identify the factors influencing customer loyalty based on
the collected customer feedback data?"	Text analysis (allows the retail company to analyze and extract valuable insights from unstructured text data, such as customer feedback from surveys, social media, and support calls. this technique helps identify patterns, sentiments, and key factors influencing customer loyalty within the textual data.)
"A data analyst working for a digital marketing agency wants to analyze
customer data to identify factors that are most strongly associated with
customer churn. The analyst has access to a database of customer information, which includes data such as age, gender, location, income, purchasing
behavior, engagement with the agency's services, and customer satisfaction
ratings.<br><br>which data analytic technique should be used to identify factors that
are strongly associated with customer churn for the agency?"	logistic regression analysis (as a statistical method used for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a customer will churn or not. in this case, the goal is to identify factors associated with customer churn, making logistic regression an appropriate choice for analyzing the relationship between various customer attributes and the likelihood of churn.)
"A car manufacturing company is looking to improve its production by analyzing how factors such as temperature, humidity, and machine performance
affect production efficiency. To identify the key factor that affects efficiency
the most, an analyst uses the regression analysis technique.<br><br>what justifies&nbsp;the use of regression analysis for the given task?"	regression analysis is used to analyze the relationship between independent variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, machine performance) and a dependent variable (e.g., production efficiency) in order to identify and quantify the impact of these variables on the dependent variable. (in the scenario of a car manufacturing company, regression analysis helps determine the key factor influencing production efficiency, enabling informed decision-making for production improvement.)
A data analyst working for a retail company analyzes the purchasing behavior of customers to identify patterns and recommend products.<br><br>which data analytic technique is most appropriate for analyzing the transaction data?	association rules (for they help identify patterns and relationships in customer purchasing behavior, allowing the data analyst to make recommendations for related or complementary products based on the observed associations in the transactions.)
"An energy company wants to predict future energy demand to optimize
production. The company has an extensive data set on historical energy
usage.<br><br>which data analytic technique is best suited for this scenario?
<br><br>&gt; time series
<br>&gt; principal component analysis
<br>&gt; multiple Regression
<br>&gt; logistic Regression"	time series (for it specifically deals with data collected over time. in the context of predicting future energy demand, historical energy usage data, which is likely recorded over different time intervals (e.g., hours, days, months), can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality that can inform accurate predictions of future energy demand.)
"A pharmaceutical company wants to understand if a new drug reduces
fevers. The data suggest a fever reduction when using the drug. The company's data analysts study the data to determine whether the effect observed
could have occurred by chance.<br><br>which data analytic calculation should the
analysts perform?"	the p-value (the p-value indicates the probability of observing the observed effect (fever reduction) or more extreme results if the null hypothesis (no effect of the drug) is true. a low p-value suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to be due to chance alone, supporting the idea that the drug may indeed have a significant impact on reducing fevers.)
