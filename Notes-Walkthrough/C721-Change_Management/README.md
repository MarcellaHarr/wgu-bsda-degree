### C721 Change Management - 3 Credits
<br>

For Change Management, I found a helpful trick: using my secondary monitor to display multiple windows simultaneously. This made reading and writing much smoother. But if you only have one monitor, you can still organize your main screen effectively by dividing it into three sections. This way, you can have all your necessary windows and files open at once while working on each task:

|                                |               |                                   |

Don't forget to grab the video, performance assessment template, pacing guide, and course tips file. You can find them either in the 'Course Tips' or 'Announcement' tabs. The pacing guide tells you which sections to focus on for each task, and that's where the 'Course Resource' info above comes from.
